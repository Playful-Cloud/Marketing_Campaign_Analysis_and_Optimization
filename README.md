\# Marketing Campaign Performance Analysis \& Optimization

\* (Evaluating Ad Effectiveness through Campaign Analytics \& Insights)



\## Introduction

The business has executed several campaigns across Email, SEO, Display Ads, and Social Media channels. Each campaign had a defined budget and generated impressions, clicks, and conversions. The team wants to better understand the performance dynamics to guide future ad spend.



\##Problem Statement

Despite running multiple campaigns across various digital channels, it's unclear which campaigns are most effective at generating conversions relative to cost and impressions. We need to assess overall campaign performance and uncover optimization opportunities.





Objectives

&nbsp;	• Identify top-performing campaigns by CTR, CR, and cost-effectiveness

&nbsp;	• Rank campaigns using custom KPIs (e.g., CR/Cost or CR × CTR)

&nbsp;	• Understand discrepancies between CTR and CR

&nbsp;	• Generate actionable insights and recommendations
