# Marketing Campaign Performance Analysis & Optimization

*(Evaluating Ad Effectiveness through Campaign Analytics & Insights)*

---

## Introduction
The business has executed several campaigns across **Email, SEO, Display Ads, and Social Media** channels.  
Each campaign had a defined budget and generated impressions, clicks, and conversions.  
The team wants to better understand the performance dynamics to guide future ad spend.

---

## Problem Statement
Despite running multiple campaigns across various digital channels, it's unclear which campaigns are most effective at generating conversions relative to cost and impressions.  
We need to assess overall campaign performance and uncover optimization opportunities.

---

## Objectives
- Identify top-performing campaigns by **CTR**, **CR**, and **cost-effectiveness**  
- Rank campaigns using custom KPIs (e.g., **CR/Cost** or **CR × CTR**)  
- Understand discrepancies between CTR and CR  
- Generate **actionable insights and recommendations**

## Dataset Handling

### Raw Data
The full datasets used in this project are **not stored in this repository** (due to file size and confidentiality).  
They consist of **2 years of marketing campaign data**, split into two CSV files.

### Sample Data
For reference and reproducibility, **sample slices (a few rows)** will be included in `/data/sample/`.  
These samples are only for structure and schema validation, **not for full analysis**.

### Reproducibility
All cleaning, feature engineering, and analysis steps are implemented in scripts (under `/scripts/` and `/notebooks/`).  
Anyone with access to the full dataset can reproduce the results by running these scripts.

### Data Access
Full raw datasets are stored separately:  
- Currently stored **locally**  
- Will be moved to **cloud storage (Google Drive)** in the future  
- Access may be shared **privately upon request** (still in progress)
